# Automated-Variant-Calling-Pipeline-using-Fastq-Input-and-Docker
This pipeline processes paired-end Fastq files (***_R1.fastq.gz and ***_R2.fastq.gz) to generate BAM, VCF, and index files. It uses Fastp, BWA, and GATK v4, and runs entirely in a Docker environment. The workflow is fully automated, ensuring seamless file generation from input to output.
